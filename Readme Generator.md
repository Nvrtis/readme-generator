  ## Installation  
  This project uses Node.js to work.
  After making sure that it is installed you will need to run "npm i"/"npm install" in the terminal where the files are located. After installing the npm package (inquirer) you can run the readme generator in the terminal by "node index".

  ## Description  
  The project uses Inquierer prompts to ask users to fill in questions that will make the readme. index.js is responsible for the questions and creating the new file, which will be the readme file, and generateMarkdown works as a template for the for the readme. Otherwise i have done some if statments which makes the readme generator a bit more customizable by making the user choose what content you want inside the readme (eg. the user can choose if they want the questions field etc.). The file will be saved with the same name as the title of your project will be.  

  ## Usage  
  The usage of this project will be to simplify how a user creates the readme file, by following a template and filling in after asking the user for relevent questions that is required in a readme file.
